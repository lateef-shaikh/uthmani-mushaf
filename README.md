# Quran mushaf in Uthmani/Madina style in HTML5

## Proof Read status
This mushaf is still **not proof read**. Please use is cautiously.

## Some background
This repositry uses text from https://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp02/%d8%ad%d9%81%d8%b5 therefore I a little bit confident that it'll have less mistakes.

## About this repository
This repository has individual HTML5 files for every soora. Since HTML5 is based on XML therefore these files can be used as an XML source for your API.

## Salient features of Uthmani script are:
* Usage of end of ayah (U+06DD) with Arabic numbers
* Usage of correct codes for Open Tanween (U+08F0, U+08F1 and U+08F2)
* Separate tags for ramooz signs within text

## Why this Quran text uses Farsi Yeh:
Final shape of Yeh in this Quran style does not have dots (nukta) at the bottom. Therefore I have used Farsi Yeh. However I have kept Alef Maqsura throughout the text wherever it's needed. Here is a video which explains it:
